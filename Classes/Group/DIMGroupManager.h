//          when someone receive a message from an unknown group,
//          it can query the group info from the neighbor immediately;
//          and its potential risk is that anyone not in the group can also
//          know the group info (only the group ID, name, and admins, ...)
//      (B) but, if we don't let the station knows it,
//          then we must shared the group info with our members themselves;
//          and if none of them is online, you cannot get the newest info
//          immediately until someone online again.
